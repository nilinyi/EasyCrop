Implementing a UI for cropping image could be a headache in iOS. Well, you might find a library which could work but it sometimes introduces tons of unnecessary features, for example, image filter, or, it might have a lot of unnecessary UI that makes it impossible to customize. However, EasyCrop is just a very very simple library. It only provides a subclass of UIView which helps you crop an image. It's just that simple.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

EasyCrop is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
